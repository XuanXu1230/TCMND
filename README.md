This repository contains the data, code, and resources related to our study on multi-omics integration and machine learning-driven network pharmacology for identifying novel therapeutic targets in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Our study combines multi-omics data, computational modeling, and network pharmacology to uncover key molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic compounds for these brain disorders.
